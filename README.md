Hello Heels is an application which allows users to select the pair of heels of their choice from a drop down list. Once selected, links based on the users selection are presented underneath the drop down with the description of the item, materials, price, as well as when the item was made. Once clicked, the user is redirected to Etsy.com where they are able to complete their order and purchase the product.
